# TakedownGPT ‚¨áÔ∏èü§ñ

This Streamlit app helps you draft takedown requests to domain registrars.

It uses a combination of autonomous LangChain Agents and OpenAI's recently introduced support for function calling to:

1. Perform a domain registrar lookup using either WHOIS or RDAP to identify the registrar for the given website
2. Search the web with DuckDuckGo to find the appropriate email address for takedown requests for that domain registrar
3. Draft a takedown request email to the hosting provider citing the reason for the takedown request

The application now relies on the OpenAI Python SDK v1 and supports the latest chat models.
